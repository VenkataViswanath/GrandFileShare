The Grand File Sharing Application demonstrates the power and flexibility of AWS services. Leveraging EC2, S3, and RDS, the application achieves scalability, reliability, and efficient storage. AWS's managed services streamline deployment, enhance security, and provide a robust foundation for future enhancements.

The System Design document has all the details of this project. It also serves as a User Manual describing all the steps to be followed to implement/run this project.
•	Users can connect to the application on http://54.157.25.177:8000/ 
Note: This IP address is subjected to change whenever the EC2 instance is stopped and relaunched, since the IP address would be released on every stop. However, the port on which the web app runs is always 8000. 

•	Any user can then see the list of available files and download them. They can also upload their files to the storage service connected to the backend of this application. This provides as a real-time file-serving leveraging Cloud Computing and Bigdata technologies.
